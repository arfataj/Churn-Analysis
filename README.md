# üìä Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction 

## üìå Overview

This project is an end-to-end churn analysis for a telecom firm, designed to understand customer attrition, predict future churners, and provide actionable insights for customer retention strategies. 

It uses a combination of SQL, Power BI, and machine learning to build a comprehensive solution.

In today‚Äôs competitive business landscape, retaining customers is vital for long-term success, and churn analysis is a key technique for achieving this.

## üéØ Project Goals

***Visualize and Analyze Customer Data:*** 
Explore customer data at different levels, including demographic, geographic, payment and account information, and services.

***Study Churner Profiles:*** 
Identify characteristics of customers who have churned to help in designing targeted marketing campaigns.

***Predict Future Churners:*** 
Develop a method to predict which customers are at risk of leaving.

## üîé Methodology
This project follows a multi-step process, from data extraction to visualization and predictive modeling.

**1. ETL Process in SQL Server:**

- An ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) framework was created to handle the customer data.
- Data was imported from a CSV source file into a staging table using the SQL Server Import Wizard.
- Data exploration was performed to check for distinct values and nulls.  
- Null values were removed, and the cleaned data was loaded into a production table.
- Views were created to facilitate data loading into Power BI for analysis.

**2. Data Modeling and Visualization (Power BI):**

- Customer data was connected to Power BI to create an interactive dashboard.
- Custom columns were added to categorize data, such as
- Churn Status and ranges for Monthly Charge, Age, and Tenure.
- Key metrics were calculated, including
- Total Customers, New Joiners, Total Churn, and Churn Rate.
- Visualizations were created to show a summary of key metrics, demographic and account information, and a churn distribution analysis.

**3. Churn Prediction (Machine Learning):**

- A Random Forest machine learning algorithm was used to predict customer churn. This algorithm was chosen for its robustness and accuracy in classification tasks.
- Data was prepared by dropping irrelevant columns and encoding categorical variables.
- The data was split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model.
- The trained model was then used to predict potential churners among new joiners.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies

- **Microsoft SQL Server:** Used for the ETL process, data cleaning, and data warehousing.
- **Power BI:** Utilized for data visualization and creating the interactive dashboard.
- **Jupyter Notebook (Python):** Employed for the machine learning model development.
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn were used for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

## üìà Key Findings & Insights

- **Dashboard Summary:** The dashboard provides a high-level overview, showing a total of 6,418 customers, with 411 new joiners and 1,732 churned customers, resulting in a churn rate of 27.0%.

- **Demographic Analysis:** The project includes visuals for churn rates based on gender and age groups.
  
- **Account and Service Analysis:** Insights were gained by analyzing churn rates related to payment methods, contract types, and specific services like internet or streaming options.

- **Predictive Model:** The Random Forest model successfully predicted future churners, providing a list of at-risk customers who can be targeted with proactive retention campaigns.
